# Generate a GitHub personal access token

> Looking for the token used by the automatic template update workflow? Follow the dedicated [automatic template synchronization guide](template_synchronization.md). It uses a repository-scoped fine-grained token with a different purpose and secret name.

If you want to work with GitHub repositories from your notebook, like cloning, editing, or pushing files, you’ll need a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). This token lets you authenticate your API calls and gives you the right permissions. The GIF below shows the steps to create a token.

> The LabConstrictor repository form accepts only a classic token, which starts with `ghp_`. A fine-grained token (it starts with `github_pat_`) is rejected.

To see the full steps, follow the instructions below.

## Create the token

1. Go to https://github.com/ and sign in.  
2. Click your profile icon (top right) ➔ **Settings**  
3. In the left sidebar, select **Developer settings** ➔ **Personal access tokens** ➔ **Tokens (classic)**  
4. On the top right side (at the same level as `Personal access tokens (classic)`), click on  **Generate new token** ➔ **Generate new token (classic)**  
5. Give your token a descriptive **Name** (e.g., `Notebook RW Token`) and set an **Expiration** if desired  
6. Under **Scopes**, tick **repo**  
   - *(Optional: To only work with public repositories, select **public_repo** instead of **repo**)*  
7. Click **Generate token** at the bottom  
8. **Copy** your new token right away. You won’t be able to see it again later!  
9. Paste the token into your notebook’s `GitHub-token` field, so API calls authenticate as the chosen owner.  

A classic token with the **repo** scope can read and write your repositories, so keep it private.
